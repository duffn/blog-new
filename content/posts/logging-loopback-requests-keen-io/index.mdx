I've been experimenting with [LoopBack](http://loopback.io/) recently, using it to prototype an API. It really is quite amazing how quickly you can get a full-fledged API up and running with LoopBack. Just follow the [getting started guide](http://loopback.io/) and you’ll see what I mean.

After getting a pretty decent API up and running, I began testing a few different ways of logging API requests. I still haven't quite settled on the way that I want to do this yet, but one issue that I did encounter was trying to get the response time of the call from [expressjs/response-time](https://github.com/expressjs/response-time).

Response-time is a great, little Node.js module that automatically adds an X-Response-Time header to your responses to indicate the time in milliseconds that the request took.

The issue that I was running into was that I could not figure out how to properly get to that header in the LoopBack afterRemote method that I was using to log requests. Thanks to an [SO](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28917210/can-i-get-to-response-headers-in-loopback-afterremote-hook/29028330#29028330) user, however, I was able to eventually get to what I wanted. The key was that the response wasn't available when I was trying to log the query -I needed to use the `res.on('finish')` event to get the response headers.

```javascript
var Keen = require("keen-js");

module.exports = function (myModel) {
  myModel.afterRemote("*", function (ctx, affectedModelInstance, next) {
    // Listen to the finish event of the response to wait
    // for the response to be available
    ctx.res.on("finish", function () {
      var client = new Keen({
        projectId: "keenprojectid",
        writeKey: "keenwritekey",
      });

      var queryEvent = {
        ip: ctx.req.ip,
        baseUrl: ctx.req.baseUrl,
        url: ctx.req.url,
        route: ctx.req.route,
        query: ctx.req.query,
        method: ctx.methodString,
        // Here's the header that I wanted to grab
        responseTime: Number(ctx.res._headers["x-response-time"]),
        keen: {
          timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
        },
      };

      client.addEvent("queries", queryEvent, function (err, res) {
        if (err) {
          console.log(err);
        } else {
          console.log(res);
        }
      });
    });

    // Don't forget to call next
    next();
  });
};
```
